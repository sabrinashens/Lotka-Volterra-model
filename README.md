# Resource-extraction-in-the-Lotka-Volterra-model
Suppose that the equation for R′ has an additional term −E, representing the rate at which the resource is extracted from the system, probably by humans (hunted, fished, gathered, etc). Find the value at E at which the population R goes extinct at given time.
